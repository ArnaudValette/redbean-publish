* This is a test

There are some /paragraphs/ in it,
spanning on multiple lines ! But there
are also some different types of *elements*,
such as structure templates:

#+begin_example
,* this is some org syntax inside an example block
#+end_example

You can write literals with the =:= character:
    : this will appear as a litteral

* Some interesting templates:

First and foremost, there are source blocks:

#+begin_src js
  const x = (a)=>a*a
  const y = (b)=>b<0?x(b+2*b):x(x(b))
#+end_src

And then quote ones :

#+begin_quote

This is a quote block

#+end_quote

** Some subtitle

- This is a list that can have children
  - children list element A
  - children list element B
- This is a second top-level list element
- This is the last list element

* Lesser elements

This implementation supports links,
images (at least they are parsed), and text formatting
such as /italic/ =verbatim= ~code~ *bold* _underline_
