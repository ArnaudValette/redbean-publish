* Introduction

[[https://redbean.dev/][readbean]] is an [[https://justine.lol/ape.html][actually portable executable]], 
it consists in a webserver in a zip executable, it also embeds =Lua=, which means that you can program
a parser that will transform markdown into html and have your blog served in a zip executable.

I will build here a Lua module that will implement this idea.

* Testing and building:

#+begin_src bash
  chmod +x redbean.com
  zip redbean.com .init.lua
  ./redbean.com -v
#+end_src

You should be able to see the tests results in the REPL.

* Roadmap/Features:

- [2/4]
  - [X] Parses a subset of org
  - [X] Parses org files
  - [ ] Converts org files to html
  - [ ] Serves them to the world
  - DONE
